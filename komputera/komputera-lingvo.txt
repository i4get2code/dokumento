;; synergy examples:
rust elixir/erlang
rust <-> micropython <-> c/++
rust python c/++  <- idris purescript
;
rust == gluon dyon <-> c/++

;; no gc examples:
rust c++ | nim || dlang

;; transpilers examples:
idris purescript | nim || lux haxe

;; ft hkt examples:
idris purescript

;; iot examples:
rust python | wren gravity || nim

;; metaprogramming examples:
elixir | nim || julia lisp redbol

;; null-safe examples:
rust idris erlang/elixir | lux kotlin scala ceylon julia

;; mobile examples:
idris python | kotlin || scala lux clojure haxe

;; wssi examples:
python lobster moonscript || nim coffescript

;; wssf examples:
idris purescript | haskell || livescript elm

;; low-high means that the language is convenient as dynamically-typed languages are
;; low-high examples:
nim kotlin scala red julia

;; homoiconic languages have a few fatal flows (imho)
;; difficult to read and understand because of extreme simplicity.
;; simplicity that is hard despite uniform, minimal and logical syntax.
;; or maybe because of that.
;; the living proof that easy and simple are not the same thing
;; ast is not meant to be read by a human being
;; ast by default maybe vulnerable to injection.
;; so safe environment is required
;;
;; the only usecase for homoiconic languages are
;; if there is a readable homoiconicity that is run within a very safe environment
;; or transpilers that have remodifiable syntax
;;
;; not appreciated homoiconic examples:
any lisp, redbol, julia
;;
;; appreciated homoiconic examples:
elixir (safe environment)
lux (transpiler sadly the project is dead)
elisp (can be tolerated since
it is in a kinda safe environment and
not really a programming language but extension language
where homoiconicity not that scary)
