=============
rule of thumb
=============

synergy
no gc
iot
metaprogramming
null-safety
mobile
functional with higher kinded types and transpiler (ft hkt)
low-high
homoiconicity

 ^
/=\

;; synergy examples:
rust c/++
any minimal language targetting it's no-gc host
anything with elixir/erlang
;
dyon, gluon => rust <= ketos, macro-lisp
chai/script, squirrel => c++
micropython => c

;; iot examples:
rust python | nim

;; no gc examples:
rust c++ | nim || dlang

;; metaprogramming examples:
elixir nim julia lisp redbol

;; null-safe examples:
rust idris erlang/elixir | lux kotlin scala ceylon julia

;; transpilers examples:
idris purescript | lux || haxe

;; ft hkt examples:
idris purescript

;; mobile examples:
idris python | kotlin || scala lux clojure haxe

;; low-high means that the language is convenient as dynamically-typed languages are
;; low-high examples:
nim kotlin scala red julia

;; simplicity that is hard despite uniform, minimal and logical syntax.
;; the living proof that simple does not mean easy
;; ast by default maybe vulnerable to injection.
;; so safe environment is required

lux (transpiler sadly the project is dead)
lfe (safe environment)
elisp (can be tolerated since
it is in a kinda safe environment and
not really a programming language but extension language
where homoiconicity is not that scary)
